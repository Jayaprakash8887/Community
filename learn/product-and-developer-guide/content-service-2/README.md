# Media service

The media service is also part of content-service. All the API's specific to media(image, audio, video, file) are exposed as part of content-service itself. These media files are always store in the blob/cloud to access publicly by mobile/web.

{% hint style="info" %}
Moving out the media-service as an independent service from content-service is planned as part of the roadmap.
